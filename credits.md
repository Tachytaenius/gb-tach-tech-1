# Credits

Thanks to everyone who helped me learn to program.
Especially, in this case:
- Evie, for her idea about entity following mechanics
- ISSOtm, for his clever snippets of code

Thanks to you for checking this project out, too.

Special thanks to all my loved onesâ€”past, present, and future!
